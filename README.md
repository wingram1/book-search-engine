## About

Welcome to my book search engine! Using this application, you can search for books using the Google Books API, and save them to your profile so you can reference them later.

This project is made with a MERN stack that uses GraphQL queries and mutations.

Deployed Application: [https://quiet-springs-42659.herokuapp.com/](https://quiet-springs-42659.herokuapp.com/)
